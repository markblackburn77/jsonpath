JSONPath is a lightweight component that allows to find and extract relevant portions out of JSON structures on the _client_ as well as on the _server_.

You can read [more about it](http://goessner.net/articles/jsonpath).

There are Wiki pages about usage and examples in [Javascript](http://code.google.com/p/jsonpath/wiki/Javascript) and [PHP](http://code.google.com/p/jsonpath/wiki/PHP).

Extensive [test examples](http://jsonpath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/) are available for JSONPath.

A PHP helper class [JsonStore](http://code.google.com/p/jsonpath/wiki/JsonStore) allows read, write and delete operations on JSON structures.
